# Simple-Calculator
Project: Simple Calculator
Description
Create a basic calculator that can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
This project will help you practice using basic input/output functions and handling errors gracefully.

Functions
How It Works
Define Operations: Functions are defined for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Error Handling: The divide function includes basic error handling to avoid division by zero.

User Interaction: The main function handles user interaction, including choosing an operation and entering numbers.

Conditionals: Use if statements to execute the correct operation based on the user's choice.

Basic Input/Output: Use input() to get user inputs and print() to display outputs.

Handling Errors Gracefully: Manage invalid inputs and avoid runtime errors using conditional statements and error messages.

**Notes**
Experiment with adding more features, such as handling more complex operations or creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.

Test the program thoroughly to ensure all edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs) are handled properly.
